# Image Captioning System to Assist the Blind

Project Title
Image Captioning System to Assist the Blind

 # Project Description

This project was undertaken as part of my 4th Semester course, which focuses on trends and techniques in artificial intelligence. I have used CNN and RNN techinques. The code is provided along with a detailed report.  The primary aim was to create a deep learning-based image captioning system to help visually impaired individuals gain access to visual information in their surroundings.

# Deep Learning Techniques
The project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques, combining computer vision and natural language processing. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract features from images, and these features are then input into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to generate descriptive text.
Dataset
The VizWiz dataset, a publicly available resource, was employed for this project. The dataset comprises images taken by visually impaired individuals along with spoken questions about the images and crowdsourced answers. This dataset provided a rich source of training and validation data, including:
Training Set: 23,431 images with 117,155 captions
Validation Set: 7,750 images with 38,750 captions
Test Set: 8,000 images with 40,000 captions

Objective
To develop an assistive technology for visually impaired individuals by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, enabling them to understand and interact with their environment through automated image captioning.

# Implementation
The project involved several key steps:
Data Preprocessing: Preparing the VizWiz dataset by extracting and cleaning image features and annotations.
Model Development: Building and training a CNN for image feature extraction and an NLP model for text generation.
Integration: Combining the CNN and NLP models into a cohesive image captioning system.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using standard metrics to ensure accurate and relevant image descriptions.
